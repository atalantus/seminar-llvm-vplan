\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Modern CPUs (SIMD-Registers, SIMD ISAs)
  \item SIMD performance gains
  \item Auto-Vectorization to help programmers utilize SIMD functionality out of the box 
  (explicit vectorization as time consuming especially when supporting multiple architectures)
  \item LLVM as popular, platform-agnostic compiler framework~\cite{10.5555/977395.977673}
  \item auto-vectorization complexity $\rightarrow$ wish for well designed, 
  interoperable system (VPlan) $\rightarrow$ transition from Loop Vectorizer + SLP Vectorizer to 
  Vectorization Plan $\rightarrow$ ongoing 8 year long effort started by Intel
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Vectorization explanation (with Code\hyp{}Examples)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Loop-Level Vectorization (Inner / Outer-Loops~\cite{llvmextloopvec,intelouterloop,10.5555/2337159.2337210,llvmouterloop,10.1145/1454115.1454119})
    \item Function Vectorization~\cite{llvmextloopvec}
    \item Superword-Level Parallelism\\Vectorization~\cite{10.1145/349299.349320}~(maybe already \cite{10.1145/3519939.3523701})
  \end{itemize}
  \item Vectorization Constraints~\cite{llvmveccontrolflow,intelvecessen} (reuse code\hyp{}examples from above)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item not always legal / applicable, e.g.: backwards data-dependencies, pointer aliasing, 
    platform backwards-compatability / support, control flow complexity (function calls, register pressure), FP inaccuracies (\texttt{-ffast-math})
    \item possible performance loss, e.g.: costly conversions (horizontal aggregations, integer division) resulting in slower overall code
    on average
    \item larger code size, e.g.: need for scalar loop-tail / epilogue
    \item (potential security vulnerablities~\cite{2023arXiv230201131K})
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{LLVM's Vectorization Plan}
\label{sec:vplan}
  Overview~\cite{llvmvec,llvmvplan,llvmextloopvec,llvmintrvplan,llvmvplanstate,llvmvplanrv,llvmouterloop,llvmvplanupdate}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item History
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Short Summary how it was before (LoopVectorize)
    \item Initial refactoring proposition by Intel
    \item Describe rough final finished VPlan architecture.
  \end{itemize}
  \item State of VPlan
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Rough algorithm description (interplay of legacy LV, legacy cost model and new VPlan) (with light code references?)
    \item VPlan structure (HCFG, \texttt{VPRegionBlock}, recipes, etc.) and modelling of IR explained via example similar to~\cite{llvmvplanstate} (What is good example? Too simple $\rightarrow$ doesn't cover enough; 
    Too complex $\rightarrow$ doesn't fit into paper.)
    \item (Outer Loop Vectorization?)
  \end{itemize}
  \item Future of VPlan (what is currently being worked on, what is planned next, what has not been planned)
\end{enumerate}
