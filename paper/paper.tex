\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item (SIMD explanation necessary?)
  \item Vectorization explanation (with Code-Examples?)
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Inner-Loop
    \item Outer-Loop
    \item Superword Level Parallelism~\cite{10.1145/349299.349320}~(maybe already \cite{10.1145/3519939.3523701})
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Vectorization Drawbacks (reuse code-examples from above)
  \begin{itemize}
    \item possible performance loss
    \item larger code size
    \item (potential security vulnerablities~\cite{2023arXiv230201131K})
  \end{itemize}
  \item LLVM short introduction
\end{enumerate}

\section{LLVM's Vectorization Plan}
\label{sec:vplan}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cost-Model (related work?~\cite{POHL2020102106})
\end{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Auto-Vectorization in GCC~\cite{autovecoptgcc, vecoptgcc}
  \item Comparison with GCC~\cite{gccllvmveccomp,10.1155/2021/3264624}
  \item (LLM-based Vectorization~\cite{taneja2024llmvectorizerllmbasedverifiedloop}, also if included maybe better fitting in "Future Work")
\end{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{Summary and Future Work}
\label{sec:summary}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item VPlan Summary and Future Roadmap~\cite{llvmvplan}
  \item Comparison/Outlook auto-vectorization vs. manual vectorization~\cite{10.1155/2021/3264624,9802745}
\end{enumerate}
