\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Beaches are a very natural part of countries and are especially useful for vacation. However, even when on travel, programmers obviously do not want to live without computers. This led to the development of \emph{beach computers}. This type of computers was introduced in 1970 by Some Inventor~\cite{intel2019man} % <-- some totally random reference
to satisfy needs of programmers, but also to boost increase their vacation productivity. \textit{To be continued.}

\section{Summary \& Outlook}
\label{sec:summary}

Oh, and here goes the summary. Future work is expected in water computers so that programmers can also be productive while swimming.
